Heejung is an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with a minor in Statistics. She joined the lab at the start of 2022. She is currently working on understanding the role of bacteriophage in the gut microbiome and how the addition of lytic bacteriophage can shape the community composition and metabolic function. The overall goal is to understand the direct affect bacteriophage can have in shaping the human gut microbiome. This will help uncover the physiological role of bacteriophage in the human gut. She has been awarded the John and Paige Lapinski Undergraduate Fellowship, Eberly College of Science Undergraduate Research Award, James W. Shigley Award in Biochemistry, Poole Family Honors Scholarship, Tsui Honors Scholarship, and George and Elizabeth Sperling Tutorial Scholarship. Outside of the lab, she participates in clubs such as American Society for Microbiology at Penn State, Nittany Chemical Society, and ENVISION. She is a teaching assistant for the chemistry department. Her hobbies include reading, painting, and watching crime TV.
