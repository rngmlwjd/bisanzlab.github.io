Susan's research project is using a meta-analysis driven approach to design synthetic microbial communities that can inhibit *C. difficile* infection. She received a Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology and Molecular Biology from Rochester Institute of Technology and worked as a research technician at Litron Laboratories designing high-throughput genetic toxicology testing, assaying genotoxins, and watering the plants. She has won speaker awards im the Huck Life Science Symposium and the Best Presentation for early-career researchers in the Changing Microbiomes Symposium. She was also awarded the Paul Berg Prize in Molecular Biology for the outstanding graduate student in the department, and the BMB Department Service Award.   Outside the lab, she extends her skillsets by constantly learning new activities such as fishing, golfing, dancing, shooting, drawing, kickboxing, and etc. Fun fact, she is a pro-nail artist!
