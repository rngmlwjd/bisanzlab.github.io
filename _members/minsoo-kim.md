Min Soo received his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from Swarthmore College, right outside Philadelphia, PA. After graduating, he worked as a research technician at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering in the Corporate Strategic Research to develop novel catalysts and high-efficiency processing of natural gases. He then worked at the Metabolomics Core at the Cardiovascular institute at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine where he utilized liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to quantitate metabolites in biological samples for the Philadelphia research community, external research investigators and industry. Since joining the Bisanz lab in 2022, Min Soo has been working to decode how multiple bacterial strains collaborate shape the chemical landscape in the gut through metabolic activities. Min Soo has received several awards during his graduate studies including Homer F. Braddock and Nellie H. and Oscar L. Roberts Fellowships, Pela Fay Braucher Scholarship, and NIH T32 award for Integrative Analysis of Metabolic Phenotypes (IAMP). When not working in lab, Min Soo enjoys cooking, fishing, and hiking!
